        How to Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle?
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Here are few points on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle:
    </h2>
        <ol type="1">
     <li>
       Maintain a balanced diet.
     </li>
    <p>
       Maintaining a balanced diet is really important as if you keep unhealthy only you will get obese which can further lead to heart problems and deficiency diseases of vitamins and minerals like Goitre, Marasamus etc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
       Drink water
    </li>
    <p>
    Drinking water is extremely important as it can cause dehydration, keeps a normal body temperature, it carries nutrients and oxygen to your cells, helps flush bacteria from our body, aids digestion, prevents constipation etc. Health experts recommend about two liters of water every day even more in summer. It depends on both external and internal factors of an individual.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
       Get enough sleep
    </li>
    <p>
    Sleep deprivation is a problem today society suffers. Common symptoms can be stress, when not active you sleep etc. This is a serious problem and effects both your physical and mental health. To solve this you need to have enough sleep. Which around 8 to 9 hours for kids and above 7 hours for adults.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
        Reduce time in video games
    </li>
    <p>
        Video games make kids violent which destroy their character when they grow up. It is not good for the mental health to play a lot of it. So reducing the time you spend on video games help your mental health.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li> 
        Reduce screen time
    </li>
    <p>
    Not only video games but reducing screen time is also important specially in these time during the pandemic. Society already spends a lot of time in screen as for online classes, online office etc. This can cause eye problems.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
        Exercising and being physically fit
    </li>
    <p>
    As mentioned before obesity can lead to heart diseases. To avoid that you need to exercise. Doing Yoga also helps as it improves mental health and flexibility of your body.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
    Avoid negative people in your life
    </li>
    <p>
        Positivity is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you have a negative friend its best if you let him/her go.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
        Take your time while eating
    </li>
    <p>
        Your brain, not your stomach, is the organ responsible for feelings of hunger and fullness. If you take your time during meals and eat more slowly, you allow your brain adequate time to send the “full” message to your stomach and allow your food to be fully ingested. Do not rely on a clean plate to tell you when it is time to stop eating.
    </p>
    <br>
    <li>
      Stop taking in tobacco
    </li>
    <p>
      The WHO (World Health Organization) has stated that Tobacco kills more than half of its users. Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. The economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the lost human capital that results from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality. Tobacco does not benefit your health but it costs you life.
